# Insurance-Score-Prediction
This was a group project that involved predction of proprety insurance hazard scores, to see whether a property is deemed fit for being insured (to identify high risk homes). The data set was from the Liberty Mutal Group, kaggle dataset. This was the final project for the fall 2018 semester. Attached is the pdf which delves into the analysis extensively.


Techniques Used: 
Detailed feature selection, construction, transformations. Imputation of missing data, treatment of data w.r.t outliers, factor reduction, one hot encoding etc. were some of the data treatment employed. Involved bagging of boosted trees, support vector machines, random forests, lasso and ridge regression through different cross validations. This regression problem, evaluation parameters such as RMSE and Gini index were used to check for accuracy of predictions.
